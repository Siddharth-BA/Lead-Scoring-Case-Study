# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Lead Scoring Case Study
Project Overview
This case study focuses on developing a robust lead-scoring model to help a business prioritize potential customers based on their likelihood to convert. The aim is to optimize marketing and sales efforts by identifying high-quality leads, reducing resource wastage, and improving conversion rates.

Objective
To build a predictive model that scores leads based on their probability of conversion, enabling the sales team to focus on high-priority leads effectively.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python (or R if applicable)
Libraries/Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Approach
Data Exploration and Cleaning

Identified and treated missing values and outliers.
Analyzed key features affecting lead conversions.
Feature Engineering

Derived meaningful insights by creating new features.
Scaled and encoded data for model compatibility.
Model Development

Built and compared multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Evaluation

Selected the best-performing model based on AUC and precision-recall scores.
Visualization and Insights

Created visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
Presented actionable insights for marketing and sales strategy.
Project Deliverables
Codebase: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.
EDA Report: Detailed analysis of the dataset with visual insights.
Model Results: Comparison of various models with performance metrics.
Visualizations: Plots to showcase key insights and recommendations.
Result: Achieved a model accuracy of approximately 80%, effectively identifying high-potential leads and enabling the sales team to prioritize efforts, thereby improving the lead conversion process.
Conclusion
This project showcases the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem. The lead-scoring model can help businesses optimize resource allocation, increase conversion rates, and drive revenue growth.
